[FSA](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action)-compliant promise [middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware) for Redux.

```js
npm install redux-promise
```

## Usage

```js
import promiseMiddleware from 'redux-promise';
```

The default export is a middleware function. If it receives a promise, it will dispatch the resolved value of the promise. It will not dispatch anything if the promise rejects.

If it receives an Flux Standard Action whose `payload` is a promise, it will either

* dispatch a copy of the action with the resolved value of the promise, and set `status` to `success`.
* dispatch a copy of the action with the rejected value of the promise, and set `status` to `error`.

The middleware returns a promise to the caller so that it can wait for the operation to finish before continuing. This is especially useful for server-side rendering. If you find that a promise is not being returned, ensure that all middleware before it in the chain is also returning its `next()` call to the caller.

## Using in combination with redux-actions

Because it supports FSA actions, you can use redux-promise in combination with [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions).

### Example: Async action creators

This works just like in Flummox:

```js
createAction('FETCH_THING', async id => {
  const result = await somePromise;
  return result.someValue;
});
```

Unlike Flummox, it will not perform a dispatch at the beginning of the operation, only at the end. We're still looking into the [best way to deal with optimistic updates](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action/issues/7). If you have a suggestion, let me know.

### Example: Integrating with a web API module

Say you have an API module that sends requests to a server. This is a common pattern in Flux apps. Assuming your module supports promises, it's really easy to create action creators that wrap around your API:

```js
import { WebAPI } from '../utils/WebAPI';

export const getThing = createAction('GET_THING', WebAPI.getThing);
export const createThing = createAction('POST_THING', WebAPI.createThing);
export const updateThing = createAction('UPDATE_THING', WebAPI.updateThing);
export const deleteThing = createAction('DELETE_THING', WebAPI.deleteThing);
```

(You'll probably notice how this could be simplified even further using something like lodash's `mapValues()`.)
